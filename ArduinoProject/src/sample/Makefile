### ARDMK_DIR
### Path to the Arduino-Makefile directory.

### ARDUINO_DIR
### Path to the Arduino application and ressources directory.
### For Arduino IDE 1.0.x
# ARDUINO_DIR       = /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java

### USER_LIB_PATH
### Path to where the your project's libraries are stored.
USER_LIB_PATH     :=  $(realpath $(PROJECT_DIR)/lib)

### BOARD_TAG & BOARD_SUB
### For Arduino IDE 1.0.x
### Only BOARD_TAG is needed. It must be set to the board you are currently using. (i.e uno, mega2560, etc.)
# BOARD_TAG         = yun
### For Arduino IDE 1.6.x
### Both BOARD_TAG and BOARD_SUB are needed. They must be set to the board you are currently using. (i.e BOARD_TAG = uno, mega, etc. & BOARD_SUB = atmega2560, etc.)
### Note: for the Arduino Uno, only BOARD_TAG is mandatory and BOARD_SUB can be equal to anything
BOARD_TAG         = yun

### MONITOR_PORT
### The port your board is connected to. Using an '*' tries all the ports and finds the right one.
MONITOR_PORT      = /dev/cu.usbmodem1411

### OBJDIR
### This is were you put the binaries you just compile using 'make'
